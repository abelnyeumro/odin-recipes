# odin-recipes

After following first steps in the course, I, for the first time face project challenge.
Even tho I created html and css projects in the past I wanted to start all over again as this course teaches how to trace progression and leave liable trace of knowledge gained.
On day to day basics I love to see the progress in the knowledge and skills and now would like to create the site about recipes. Also, I hope to always leave a little bit of art if possible in the sites I create, that being little css styles that let that artistic side of me personlize knowledge gained.
